# C# OOP Project – Spawn Animated Fireworks in Windows Forms With Click Event

Hi, in this tutorial we will make a interesting little application where you can spawn and animate a fireworks animation with click event in windows form. This is was a novel idea and a very interesting project to make, I am excited to show you the solution we found on this project. This project is packed with features such as loading background images to the application and changing them dynamically during run time, playing the fireworks animation on top of the backgrounds transparently and with smooth animation. We will be using OOP programming to make this application. We will create a Class for the firework object and give instruction on what they should do when we it spawn it on the screen. We will be making this tutorial in Visual Studio 2022. You can use any version that’s available to you. Follow along with the tutorial video below and have fun making this little application.
